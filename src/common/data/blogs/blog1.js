    title:'A Comprehensive Overview of Artificial Intelligence',
    content:`AI is a machine’s ability to carry out tasks that are supposed to be brain-intensive. It is the
    imitation of natural intelligence in technological systems that have been trained to learn and
    imitate human behavior. Game-playing, language translation, robotics, and expert systems are
    examples of typical applications. Although artificial intelligence has existed since antiquity, it
    took the advent of 1940’s digital computing devices to see the first signs of real intelligence.
    Early AI initiatives included playing chess and figuring out arithmetic issues. The effects of
    artificial intelligence on civilization are hotly contested. Many contend that AI enhances daily life
    by performing commonplace and even complex jobs better than humans can, making life easier,
    safer, and more productive. Others contend that AI increases the risk of identity theft, worsens
    racism by standardizing people, and drives up unemployment by costing workers their jobs.`,
    content1:`People throughout the world are fascinated by and interested in AI. But through 2019, the rate
    of adoption in the commercial world has trailed behind the degree of enthusiasm. However, as
    2020 approaches, we are observing an increase in both interest and AI use. The global AI market
    was close to $ 59.67 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 39.4% to reach
    close to $ 422.37 billion by 2028. By 2024, $31 billion is anticipated to be spent on the
    machine-learning labor market.`,
    content2:` Businesses mostly utilize AI to increase the effectiveness of their processes, automate
    labor-intensive jobs, and create data-driven business predictions. Experts say that in the future,
    the majority of organizations would switch to systems, applications, security systems, data
    analysis, and other applications driven by AI. Forbes data indicates that since 2000, the number
    of AI firms has expanded internationally 14 times, while investments in these have climbed six
    times. We anticipate that businesses will use AI across their entire company, either by creating
    their own AI from scratch or implementing pre-built AI applications. For instance, 40% of those
    who are presently employing AI, according to the poll, indicated they are creating
    proofs-of-concept for certain AI-based or AI-assisted initiatives, and 40% are utilizing pre-built
    Artificial intelligence applications, chatbots, and virtual agents.`,
    
    subtitle1:`The Rate of AI Adoption`,
    contentSubTitleOne:`The rate of AI adoption is increasing quicker than many anticipated thanks to advancements in
    data discovery and administration, system skills training, and AI explaining ability.`,
    contentSubTitleOne1:`
    45% of respondents from major organizations claimed to have used AI, compared to 29% of
    respondents from small and medium-sized businesses.`,
    contentSubTitleOne2:` 
    How do we gauge whether artificial intelligence is behaving like a human?
    An AI entity’s resemblance to a human being can be determined by:\n
    `,
    contentSubTitleOnePoint1:`● Turing Exam: The AI entity must be able to communicate with a human agent to pass the
    Turing Test.
    `,
    contentSubTitleOnePoint2:`● Approach to Cognitive Modeling: Examining our thinking and developing a model from it.`,
    contentSubTitleOnePoint3:`
    ● The Rule of Thinking: The intensive array of logical propositions known as the rule of
    thinking directs how our minds function.
    `,
    contentSubTitleOnePoint4:`
    ● Utilizing Rational Agents: The goal of a rational agent is to get the best result feasible
    given the situation at hand.
    `,
    text: `One must go deeply into the many Artificial Intelligence sub-domains`,
    contentSubTitleOnePoint5:`● ML teaches a computer how to draw conclusions and make decisions based on prior
    knowledge. It recognizes trends and examines historical data to deduce the significance
    of these points and arrive at a potential conclusion.
    `,
    contentSubTitleOnePoint6:`● An ML technique is deep learning. It trains a machine to classify, infer, and analyze the
    outcome by processing inputs through layers`,
    contentSubTitleOnePoint7:`
    ● Computer vision algorithms attempt to comprehend a picture by dissecting it and
    examining various aspects of the object.    
    `,
    contentSubTitleOnePoint8:`
    ● By analyzing text, audio, images, and other inputs the way a human would, cognitive
    computing algorithms attempt to simulate the functioning of the human brain and
    attempt to produce the intended results. Google is one of the popular systems for data
    analysis.
