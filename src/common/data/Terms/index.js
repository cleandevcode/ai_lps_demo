    services works fairly for everyone and with the best possible user experience.
    This should always mean the quality of service to every user, in an

    personal and small business work. Startup plan is for new startups and for
    small businesses and Agency plans are for small and medium size agencies.
    Large agencies and small enterprises are desired to choose premium plans or

    API.`,

    safety of our service and that of our partners. To check any misuse of our
    services, we assume that in our Professional, Startup and Agency plans,
    users will not make articles/blog posts using our AI Article Writer 1.0 and 2.0
    more than 20 numbers, 40 numbers and 80 numbers per day respectively.
    Any usage higher than these limits will not be considered as normal usage.

    pattern of any users in previous and present months.`,

    distributing their unlimited account login details to others in lieu of monetary
    gains and considers such activities as illegal activities. One seat is basically
    for one user only and multiple users in one login account are not permitted.
    Thus, our system identifies such behavior and automatically adjusts certain
    parameters temporarily based on abnormal, heavy usage patterns within a
    short period of time. When such activity is detected by the system, you might
    notice a decline in quality of the output. This usually resolves itself with the
    renewal of your monthly cycle.`,
